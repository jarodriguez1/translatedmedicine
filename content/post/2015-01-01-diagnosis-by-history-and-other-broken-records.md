I ran late in clinic yesterday (not uncommon), but it was worth it. Despite labs, imaging and a ton of other data, much of medicine currently relies on gathering a history, just plain talking to the patient, especially when it comes to syncope (fainting). There is so much in the nuance in which questions get asked and how the questions are asked as well as the nuance of the patientâ€™s answer. All of these subtleties help determine testing, diagnosis, and treatment. With so much reliance on conversations, it is difficult to even consider interviewing a LEP patient without the aid of an interpreter. Though it may take extra time to find an interpreter or to set up the telephone/video service, it is worth it if it means better care. 

>Yes, I ran over in clinic yesterday, and yes Iâ€™d do it again.
