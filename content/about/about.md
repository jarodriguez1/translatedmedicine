I am a health technology equity researcher and [hospitalist](https://www.acponline.org/about-acp/about-internal-medicine/general-internal-medicine/hospital-medicine). I will be starting at at [Brigham and Women's Hospital Department of General Internal Medicine] in the fall of 2019 (https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/general-internal-medicine-and-primary-care/research). 

My research focuses on achieving digital health equity. My passion lies in the meaningful intersection of medicine, social justice, and technology. I also like to spend my time writing, tinkering, and coding (currently in R).

Where can you find me?
