I am a hospitalist and Clinical Informatics fellow in the Division of Clinical Informatics at BIDMC. My research focuses on achieving digital health equity. My passion lies in the meaningful intersection of medicine, social justice, and technology. I also like to spend my time tinkering and coding (currently in R).
