      <description>In my first two parts of this series, we looked at the changes in income along the The Orange Line and The Red Line. I went through my approach for creating a New Yorker inspired visualization of income along the Boston T.
For this post, we take a look at the The Green Line. Below you will see median household income along each of the four lines of the Boston Green Line.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this series, I went through my approach for creating a New Yorker inspired visualization of income along The Orange Line on the Boston T.
For this post, we take a look at the The Red Line. Below you will see median household income along both lines of the Boston Red Line.

      <description>As a native New Yorker, I was recently intrigued by a visualization of household income in NY highlight inequality ( New Yorker ). Having lived in Boston for going on 9 years, I’ve started to call this place home. Could I make a similar representation of income in Boston? That was my challenge!

      <description>It was two o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon and Abigail* was in the emergency room for the third time this month. I was able to step away from the day-to-day struggles of the general inpatient medicine floors to see her in the emergency department. I had promised to keep her out of the hospital, and I had failed again.
As I entered the commotion of the emergency room, I scanned above each door looking for room 33, Abigail’s room.</description>

      <title>Hacking for the Underserved</title>

      <description>What comes first: the problems, or the tools to solve them?
It seems at times as if the newest technology on the block has become more important than creating actual solutions to healthcare problems. In the digital health landscape, hackathons have run counter to the tools-first tenet. Over a two to three day period, hackathons bring together patients, computer programmers, designers, clinicians and investors to create scalable technology solutions for healthcare’s most pressing problems.</description>

      <description>“I haven’t been exercising as much this month.” I’d failed at inspiring yet another patient to be more active. She was a middle aged women working two jobs to help support her family. What next? Do I recommend a wearable?
The choices we make everyday impact our health. Individual behaviors can lead to significant disease states including high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. The HealthyPeople 2020 campaign identifies individual behaviors as one the key social determinants of health.</description>

      <description>Overcoming the Literacy Burden Using Voice-Mediated Interfaces The literacy and numeracy burden represents one of the major barriers to engaging patients in their health. Efforts to offer patients open access to their data afford those who are health literate an empowering opportunity. However, patients who struggle with literacy and numeracy may not benefit. Poor literacy itself it is a risk factor for poor health outcomes. Though current representation of health data relies on text-based tools, I wonder if patients are more comfortable with having verbal conversations about their health.</description>

      <title>Can We Bring Machine Translation Beyond The Hype?</title>

      <description>20% of the U.S. population speaks a language other than English at home and 8.6% defined as being limited English proficient. How do we reach all of these patients? Google Translate! or Google Translate?
Machine translation, the power behind Google Translate, offers an opportunity to reach our limited English proficiency patients. Take English content, parse it and use statistical algorithms to translate the material. The low hanging fruit are public health materials, consent forms, clinic forms, insurance forms and other standard or reusable materials.</description>

      <title>Connected Health Symposium 2015 in Review: 8 Takeaways</title>

      <description>I recently attended the Connected Health Symposium in Boston, MA. The Symposium was filled with thought-provoking keynotes, panels and discussions. With all these great ideas, it was tough to parse through the data, but I’ve captured a few key takeaways:
1. The Future is Wearables vs. The Folly of the Wearable There was an intriguing tension between the power of wearables, and the potential overhyping of wearable. On the one hand, the symposium presented several panels discussing the current uses of wearables and the exhibit hall had the likes of Withings and Muse.</description>

      <description>Between Doctors on Demand, Teladoc and other online platforms, patients are willing to get their care online, but are clinicians trained to shift from bedside manner to “webside manner?” Telemedicine has quickly risen to be a novel clinical access point for patients.
Innovation (yes, I said it) is impacting the way we provide medical care; however, we need to reflect on where our current supply of clinicians is coming from and whether they are being trained to provide care in this context.</description>

      <description>Health messages can be a tough sell. Not surprisingly, we are not doing of great job at getting patients to buy into preventative services. But what if these messages showed up their on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter? (#colonoscopy, anyone?)
Things we know:
1.We are not doing well at encouraging patients to get screened. For colon cancer screening, only 58.6% of adults over 50 were up-to-date with their screening. These percentages are lower for low income and racial/ethnic minorities.</description>

      <description>There’s value in my patients’ words.
 I want to get the most direct access to them. When I was in high school I read “Cien Años de Soledad” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. To this day, it is one of my favorite novels. I read it in Spanish and couldn’t imagine reading the translated version. I can’t get away from the feeling that something is lost. Though the words may be the same, but the nuance of the language as they author is meant it, is lost.</description>

      <description>We roll deep in academic medicine. Every morning during morning rounds, there are on average 5-6 doctors at the bedside to check in on patients. I don’t know about you, but I’m terrible with names when I’m at my healthiest. Now take a patient admitted for pneumonia, urinary tract infection, heart failure, or another draining ailment, trying to remember the name of their 5-6 doctors. Not happening…right? Right! The biggest study looking at this was done at the University of Chicago.</description>

      <title>Intubations Misunderstood</title>

      <description>This month I have been spending my time working hard in the Intensive Care Unit–where intubations are an unfortunate necessity. I invariably started thinking about who gets intubated. We look at many factors to assess a patient’s ability to breathe, such as respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood gas, and, of course, their ability to speak. Always keeping LEP patients in mind, I wondered what impact language discrepancies would have on the rates of intubation.</description>

      <description>I ran late in clinic yesterday (not uncommon), but it was worth it. Despite labs, imaging and a ton of other data, much of medicine currently relies on gathering a history, just plain talking to the patient, especially when it comes to syncope (fainting). There is so much in the nuance in which questions get asked and how the questions are asked as well as the nuance of the patient’s answer.</description>

      <description>During one overnight in the intensive care unit, I took care of 2 patients: one was Polish speaking, who I will call Peter, and the other was Spanish speaking, who I will call Teresa.
For Teresa, the night started off with pain and ended with her unexpected passing. Her nurse could tell she was in pain, but could not understand where the pain was. Interpreter services were unfortunately difficult to access on this particular night.</description>
