      <description>As a native New Yorker, I was recently intrigued by a visualization of household income in NY to highlight inequality on the New Yorker.
library(acs)library(httr)library(plotly)library(tidyverse)library(ggthemes)library(scales)library(ggmap)library(ggplot2)I created MBTA location csv files to help with the project.
mbta = read.csv(&amp;quot;mbta_orange.csv&amp;quot;)Some clean up:
#Create tract emptymbta$tract = NaNmbta$county = NaNmbta$income = NaNmbta$Longitude = as.numeric(mbta$Longitude)mbta$Latitude = as.</description>

      <description>What comes first: the problems, or the tools to solve them?
It seems at times as if the newest technology on the block has become more important than creating actual solutions to healthcare problems.
