Upon thorough inspection the sharps team removed ~45 syringes from the area.  Constituant Alex Durso was notified of the cleanup and has said that he is planning on bringing in contractors this evening to cut down the overgrowth. -John Canty   ","Needle Pickup","Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline","Needle Program","Needle Pickup","GEN_Needle_Pickup","GEN_","https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5594abdc6963e4b692e363ea/report.jpg","","95 Von Hillern St  South Boston  MA  02127",6,"05",2,"C6","Dorchester",5,"Ward 7","0707","95 Von Hillern St",2127,42.3594,-71.0587,"Citizens Connect App","https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/streetview?location=42.3594,-71.0587&size=600x400&key=AIzaSyDlLoQ8olGkr3hI51HtSLCaHDENjQklT6E"
