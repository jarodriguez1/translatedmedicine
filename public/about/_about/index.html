        <p>I am a hospitalist and Clinical Informatics fellow in the Division of Clinical Informatics at BIDMC. My research focuses on achieving digital health equity. My passion lies in the meaningful intersection of medicine, social justice, and technology. Thus far, I have presented my work revealing a new digital divide for limited English proficiency patients at local, regional, and national conferences. I was recently awarded the inaugural BIDMC UiM Fellow and Jr. Faculty Career Development Research Award. I continue to foster alliances with community stakeholders to use technology as a transformative tool for empowering underserved patients in their care.</p>

<p>For my undergraduate training, I attended Brown University, where I majored in biochemistry. I also took my first computer science class at Brown, exposing me to the potential impact of technology. I completed my medical training at Tufts University School of Medicine, where I participated in research exploring the human computer interaction. I recently finished residency in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, which provided critical insights into the clinical and social barriers many patients face in obtaining quality healthcare. My experiences as a resident also facilitated my keen understanding of how those barriers can be overcome with novel solutions.</p>

<p>I was born in Cartagena, Colombia and immigrated to the US with my parents. I grew up in Queens, New York with my younger sister. I am married to my high school sweetheart.</p>
